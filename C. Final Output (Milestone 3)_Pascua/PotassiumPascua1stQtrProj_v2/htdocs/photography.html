  <p id="IntroductionToPhotography_Paragraph">In the fine art of aerial photography, learning the basics is essential to 
getting your desired photo. To my knowledge, the most basic and crucial rules to be followed in photography are, centering 
your subject, focusing on it, and adjusting the perfect exposure for the subject and its background. Following these rules, 
you too can achieve the photo of your dreams.</p>
